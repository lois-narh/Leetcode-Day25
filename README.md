# Merge K Sorted Linked Lists

This project includes a JavaScript implementation of the classic algorithm to **merge K sorted linked lists** into a single sorted list. It uses a **custom min-heap (priority queue)** to efficiently pick the smallest element across all lists.

##  Problem Statement

Given an array of `k` sorted linked lists, merge them into a single sorted linked list and return its head.
